# Principal-Component-Analysis

In this project, I have

1. Implemented the main steps of PCA, 
2. Applied it to an image data set.
3. Implemented PCA for high-dimensional datasets and performed a brief analysis of computation time.

Note: All the helpful mathematical information is written inside the notebook. MNIST Dataset is used for this project.
